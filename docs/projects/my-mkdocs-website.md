# Making This Website Using mkdocs

*Written on: 02.11.2025*

This article addresses how I made the website and how you could give a go at mkdocs or alternatives of it.

## What Does mkdocs Do?

Mkdocs is an open-source static site generator and is specifically designed for building project documentation. It converts markdown files (.md files) into a styled static documentation website. It is a python-based tool that converts the .md files into the corresponding .html and .js files with the appropriate formatting. Styling is done under a theme such as mkdocs-material, and others.

The proper structure of the .md files within directories and **mkdocs.yml**  to apply the configurations of mkdocs make up the website. 

Console commands such as the following preview the website locally and build the static website from the .md files respectively:

```bash
mkdocs serve

mkdocs build
```

Another very useful command is:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

It deploys the website directly onto GitHub pages by uploading the built website to a **gh-pages** branch for hosting under the user name and repository name. I would advise using it instead of trying to set up the static built website on GitHub pages yourself.

## How I Structured The Website

As you may have noticed already, the website consists of the following main sections:
- CV
- Projects
- Blogs
- Announcements
- Contact
- Goals
- About
- and the default index page that is automatically generated by mkdocs.

A clean directory structure reflecting your website's navigation is helpful but not necessary as long as you can route every navigation item properly to its corresponding .md file. The .yml should be edited accordingly (note that it is very sensitive to indentations, which have to be consistent, and not TABBED according to my experience).

The extensions I use are required to expand the avaiable .md functionalities that are built into .html files as mkdocs only has the base .md functionalities at the start.

Blogs is the most complex directory system of my website. You can study its structure as reference. blogs branches into the different sub-sections which branch out into the actual articles with image/assets folders in every directory to host the assets (makes pathing from individual .md files easier).

## How You Could Try mkdocs

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from [cedricfyc/my-cv-blog](https://github.com/cedricfyc/my-cv-blog/tree/main#)

### Create a Virtual Environment

- If you do not have Python, downlaod and set-up from [Python - Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- Go to the directory within the console

```bash
cd path-to-your-project
```

- Create the virtual environment (I used Python 3.12+)

```bash
python -m venv env
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment (it will contain the dependencies at the given versions).

- For Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- For Linux/macOS

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

### Install the Dependencies

Within the directory of the project, you will find a requirements.txt. Install the dependencies from it.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Adjust Some .md Files

Following the markdown syntax given at [Markdown Cheatsheet](../blog/misc/cheatsheet.md), make the adjustments you want to visualise on given pages.

### Serve the Website Locally

Serve to a port on your local network (it's safe).

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

[http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) is the default url, just follow it and if you set-up everything correctly, the website should now be hosted locally on your local network.

### Experiment with the mkdocs.yml

Feel free to adjust the configurations within mkdocs.yml to personalise pages. All the documentation is listed in the [resources section](#resources) of this article.

## My Goals With The Website

The website was originally inspired by me wanting to have a personal website and the fact that I am also working on some documentation work as part of my internship.
I intend to present my cv, projects and blogs. I like adding new features to expand the possibilities within the website and wish to provide users with a great experience.
