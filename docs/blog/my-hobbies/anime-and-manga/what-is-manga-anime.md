# What Is Manga And What Is Anime?

*Written on 21.10.2025*

Manga and anime are terms that are regularly covered in the current pop culture. I have always been a great fan of anime and since my teenage years, I have been more into mangas than animes. I have tried hundreds of series from each media (rookie numbers, I know haha). They have marked my life greatly, influencing how I think and who I am now.

This article aims to define the two media and possibly introduce you to my tastes and ways to get into these forms of entertainment.
Before starting with the history and current state of the two media, I would like to firstly define both.

## Definition

Manga refers to Japanese comic books or graphic novels. They are typically black-and-white, serialised in magazines and cover a wide variety of genres, ranging from cute patootie magic girls to seinen content playing with legal content limits. Manga is read in right-to-left format, which is traditional in Japan.

Anime is Japanese animation comprising of TV shows,films and web series. Similarly to mangas, it covers a broad plethora of genres and target audiences. Anime are most often adaptations of manga, light novels, video games or original works due to their more demanding and costly nature to produce.

Anime is considered more mainstream than manga and constitutes an easier entry point into the anime-manga universe.

## Origins: Modern History Mainly

### Origins of Manga
Storytelling in the form of drawn works with some influence from Western comics emerged in the late 19th-early 20th century in Japan. Past the Post-WWII boom, Osamu Tezuka (a.k.a the "God Of Manga") revolutionised manga in the 1940s to 50s with cinematic storytelling. He is well known for his work "Atom, 1952". 

Decades later in the 1970s, manga diversified into more specific genres shōnen (boys), shōjo (girls), seinen (adult men), and josei (adult women). Those are loose categories that classify the works in terms of their target audiences. Those helped create boundaries between the genres, even though many works (e.g. Code Geass, XXXHolic, arguably One Piece, etc.).

### Origins of Anime
Anime has its origins in Japan's first animated films in the 1910s to 1920s. Those were short experimental works and anime was only ever born officially in the 60s when Japan's first popular TV anime series was released: Astro Boy (1963) following Osamu Tezuka's influence.

Anime would only grow more mainstream with titles such as Akira, Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and recently enough Demon Slayer. These classics in the world of anime helped anime gain popularity outside of the Japanese culture sphere.
