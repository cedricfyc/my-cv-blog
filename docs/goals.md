# Goals

This section aims to give you an idea of my progress on the website's content. Based on how feasible a feature is as I am working on it, it will either be implemented or cancelled and put into the trash.

## Implemented
- [x] Deploy Website
- [x] Complete CV and remaining empty pages
- [x] Giscus Discussion Section
- [x] Implement E-mail system to receive feedback
- [x] Implement a toggeable light/dark mode
- [x] Add feedback feature and links to it at the end of articles
- [x] Add a footer with contact details
- [x] Add social card(s)
- [ ] Implement RSS feed
- [ ] Implement newsletter system
- [ ] Implement GH Actions for automatic updates of GH Pages
- [ ] Add projects to project page
- [ ] Implement dynamic change log -> Python script with git and file management
    - To be implemented as a script that detects latest changes in git
    - Orders files in descending order of change timestamp for each file
    - Extracts the top 5 lines of the article to put into a summary .md file
    - Summary .md file with 5 or more articles will form the blog update page

## Cancelled

- [ ] ~~Implement analytics functions for feature improvement~~
    - Not possible due to lack of transparency around Google Analytics
    - Other analytics services were either paid or a pain to set-up
    - I deemed that a simple feedback form would be enough.
