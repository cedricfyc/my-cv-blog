# How I came to Learn English

## Current State

English is pretty much my best spoken language at this point in time (praying that German or Spanish overtake it). I have been speaking it regularly for the past 3-4 years since I have thought of studying in Germany. I have a C1 (Telc 8.0) in English and have full confidence in my English skills in any kind of setting. Any topic of interest that I have and even ones foreign to me can be an object of debate for me. Politics, philosophy (I found most of its topics boring though), sciences and technology present pretty much no barriers to me. My English is at the moment top-notch (yeah, I am glazing myself) and most slangs and accents are not unknown to me. However, this was not always the case, as I had once a pretty bad English (all throughout my childhood).

## My History Learning English
The main national education system in Mauritius is centered around passing the Cambridge O-Level and A-Level exams, and as such, classes are taught in English. I attended a private primary school called Safe & Sound where the main language of instruction was French with some hints of English, but French was really the focus. This coincided perfectly with my liking for French since a young age. My parents would always, always speak French to me. Some Kreol here and there, but French was the language that they decided to teach me. English and Kreol would have to wait and were just side characters for the first 10 years of my life.

English was a chore, French wasn't. Learning the English alphabet was a pain, speaking English? Never could until my late teens... My only exposure to English for my entire childhood and early teenage years was through the teachings of the English teacher and some shows I could barely follow even with subtitles. I was a monolingual kid with some understanding of Kreol and English. I felt ashamed of not speaking proper Kreol, my supposed mother tongue. But that is some other story to tell in my [Kreol yap](kreol-yap.md).

My monolingual situation however changed drastically starting in highschool. I could previously (in Primary) write proper English essays of 200+ words, but they would pale in comparison to my French vocabulary and mastery of grammar back then. No phrasal verbs, no use of tenses over than simple past and present and future and only typical old proverbs such as "it is raining cats and dogs". Imo, no one uses those expressions anyways. We would rather say that it is pouring or simply "f*ck this rain". What changed my perspective on English was YouTube and anime "streaming" websites. I had suddenly access to a plethora of content in English, millions of times greater than what I had before that on the French broadcasting services, the shite MBC English content and the overly fast delivery of English in North American movies.

Hence for the following 4-5 years of highschool, I exposed myself to purely content in English, coming to B2 levels of the language. The HSC (A-Levels internationally) exams had me preparing myself for the annoying general paper (GP) exam. Common knowledge and critical thinking (supposedly) were king, and I had to get to know more about world politics and past events, which at that time was the very last thing I wanted. Unknowingly to me, it sparked some casual interest in politics. I was already a fan of history but my liking for politics as a discussion topic paled in comparison. Thanks to that course that forced politics and societal disucssions, I am now a very politically enthusiastic person. 

My YouTube feed would be mostly composed by self-improvement, historical, political and some tech video recommendations. Coming to Germany and starting to learn Spanish, it only injected some German and Spanish videos in my feed, but English is still dominating my feed.

## My Plans With The English Language

I do not plan anything drastic with English. I have deemed myself to have mastered the language at this point and given that I am exposed to it on a regular basis during my studies and possibly later on at work, I do not need to focus explicitly on it. That does not even taken into account the overwhelming amount of English content that I consume daily through YouTube, documentation, news, etc. I am glad to have achieved so much in English and now wish to expand my knowledge in other languages so that I may feel as confident in them. One could say that I should not be too complacent, but when one knows 5 languages at a conversational level or better, there is no real focus possible unless more time is dedicated to learning languages (which I am simply not ready to do).
