# My Experience with Climbing

*Written on: 25.10.2025*

## Pop Culture around Climbing

Climbing has been a part of pop culture for some years now. I feel like it was some time after the opening up of institutions after the COVID-19 lockdowns that my YouTube feed and Instagram feed were being injected with climbing content. Indoor and outdoor climbing were concepts I had not seemingly not thought of yet. I was first introduced to climbing through a YouTube video that I was recommended on my feed featuring Chris Sharma reaching the top of [Es Pontás, Mallorca](https://youtu.be/cM8gO4IDN_s). Actually even before that, I had known of Magnus Midtbø thanks to his collaborations with other fitness influencers. 

I would also find more and more indoor climbing and outdoor climbing videos in my feed. Then, it clicked in, how climbing was actually becoming more and more mainstream. Years ago, I unknowingly was exposed to climbing through Alain Robert ([French spiderman climbs Burj Khalifa](https://youtu.be/w7RLDvfM9HQ)). Climbers were suddenly everywhere: [Emil Abrahamsson](https://www.youtube.com/@EmilAbrahamsson), [Janja Garnbret](https://youtu.be/-EsdeUBBVNM), [Adam Ondra](https://youtu.be/ZRTNHDd0gL8), [Alexander Megos](https://www.youtube.com/@alexandermegosAM) and [Alex Honnold](https://youtu.be/3-wjmIFlnNo). Those are all amazing climbers who are so good that they have pushed the sport to mainstream levels of popularity.

Climbing is becoming more and more popular as climbing gyms are opening in smaller cities in the world, having already conquered the bigger ones. I won't talk more about this, you can just see for yourself how incredible it is through the videos I linked.

## How I Got Into Climbing

I was invited over for climbing one day by a friend (thanks Feliks, much love ❤️) and after seeing the YouTube vids and shorts, I decided to finally give it a try. My first climbing gym [Kletterzentrum - Schweinfurt](https://kletterzentrum-schweinfurt.de/) gave me a great first experience. Very encouraging atmosphere where people are supportive and mindful (mostly in contrast to gym culture) and climbing on the plastic holds indoors made me feel like a kid again. With a fee of 5.50 euros + 3 euros for the shoes, I initially thought of it as being steep, and so decided that climbing would be a once in two weeks experience with friends. This didn't change (I am cheap af), but what changed was how I got more serious with bouldering especially over time.

I got new climbing shoes: [La Sportiva - Tarantula](https://www.lasportiva.com/de/schuhe-klettern-tarantula-herren-zfcs146) (they should be tighter than your regular fits, 1,0 to 2,0 smaller, but I bet friends will guide you well or [Climbing Shoe Sizing on r/indoorbouldering](https://www.reddit.com/r/indoorbouldering/comments/ysp497/climbing_shoe_sizing/) and [Climbing shoes size on r/climbergirls](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbergirls/comments/qmfd11/climbing_shoes_size/)).

It felt very satisfying sending projects (which I do not really have lol, I just climbed once every few weeks). My other visits at climbing were at [Der Steinbock - Erlangen](https://www.dersteinbock-erlangen.de/) and at [Rockinn - Würzburg](https://rockinn-wuerzburg.de/). I am still learning how to climb, even though the frequency of visits has decreased since I have started my internship and considering the current conditions, working a full-time job, going to the gym and climbing will be a constant juggle of my free time (fml).

## Resources To Get Into Climbing

The climbing community is very welcoming and helpful to beginners. There are subreddits, YouTube comment sections, clubs at your local climbing gym, and most surely a climbing group at your university if you are a student.
Also most climbers you will meet are nerds/geeks (do not kill me for not caring about the difference here). If you are one, you will feel very welcomed by people who like min-maxing stuff.

Here are some resources that I hope can help you get into it:
