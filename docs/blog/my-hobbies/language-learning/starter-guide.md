# Language Learning Starter Guide

*Written on: 19.10.2025*

## Introduction

This guide aims to act as fundamental guide to starting most common languages or in this specific case
German and Spanish which are the two languages that I learned in the past few years. As of writing this article,
experience in the respective languages are as follows:

| Language         | Level  |
|------------------|--------|
| Mauritian Creole | Native |
| French           | C1/C2  |
| English          | C1     |
| German           | B2     |
| Spanish          | B1     |

I would like to compile my experience with learning languages in case it helps me or others who want
to master another language in the future. I will add further resources to the language learning section,
primarily focusing on the perspective of a latin-based languages (i.e. Spanish, Portuguese, French, etc.)
with some knowledge of Germanic languages (i.e. English and German).

**Note**: I hold zero experience in learning a language from the perspective of a Slavic, Asian (i.e. Mandarin, Hindi, Tamil, etc.)
or Arabic dialects speakers. Hence, please understand that Spanish and German are considered easier to learn languages for me.
Mandarin is considered very hard with thousands hours of practice of active learning to reach B2 + levels.

## Some Language Theory
I believe strongly in active listening and comprehensible input as the base of any language learning.
From the levels A1 to B1 (even up to B2 arguably), the main focus is to cram in as much raw knowledge as possible.
As adults with limited time for such input over thousand of hours like we used to do as children, it is more efficient
to devise the best methods to learning languages.

Adults hold a massive advantage over children even though they lost the plasticity and ability to fully adopt a language.
Adults understand structure and grammar in language more easily. They do not have to brute force the learning as they
used to as toddlers and children.

They can recognise patterns between languages and actively exploit those. For instance, the connection between thousands of
English words and French words following the Norman Conquest (1066). And of course, English and German, French and Spanish and
even German and French. The connections between languages is important to establish as they ease greatly the process of creating
patterns in one's mind to achieve mastery of a language.

My strengths in language learning would be learning Romance languages or other Germanic languages. Being a mostly pragmatic person,
I stick to whichever languages I like and are **easy to learn**. Hence, German and Spanish were my top choices.

Consider the examples given below to illustrate my point,

## How Do I Start Learning A New Language?

As mentioned in the previous section, learning a foreign language as an adult is different from one's experience
learning one's native language and is based greatly on one's starting native languages. I liken this to picking a
native element (or in this case, being forced to pick a native element) and having to learn how to manipulate over elements.
If let's say I could manipulate water freely. Ice manipulation would not be far fetched, but lava generation would be.

In my case,

- Water -> Mauritian Creole
- Ice -> French
- Vapour -> English/Spanish
- Blood (manipulation) -> German
- Lava -> Arabic

Based on the knowledge points mentioned, my advice would to:

### Step 1
Identify an easy-to-learn language (should still be fun)

### Step 2
Research on popular topics in the language learning sphere

### Step 3
Obtain as many resources to start your immersion and comprehensible input (free content as far as possible).

### Children's Books

---

### Language Exchange Apps
- Tandem  
- HelloTalk  
- italki  

---

### Flashcard Apps
- Anki  
- FluentU  
- DuoCards  

---

### Websites
- [Grammar in German on Lingolia](https://www.lingolia.com/de/)
- [Grammar in Spanish on Lingolia](https://www.lingolia.com/es/)
**Note**: With reference again to my take on the input hypothesis, I would advise learning your target language's grammar in the given target language. Learning Spanish or German grammar while still reading it in English is passable for A1, but past that, it is a waste of learning potential.

---

**Note**: You will notice that I have not mentioned Duolingo. This is due to the fact that I believe that it is not a suitable
app for learning languages. It is more of a video game than actual language learning application. The content covered ranges from A0 to A2,
one will not encounter higher levels or even reach beginner levels at the same rate as on other beginner content (imo). Feel free to
experiment with other resources, but my experience with Duolingo has only brought minimal results.

### Step 4
Immerse yourself in the language with a minimum of 1 hour of exposure per day. It can be any form of content: speaking, listening, reading or writing. However, following the principles of the input hypothesis, it is best to assimilate the language as much as possible at the start by means of
listening and reading (hence comprehensible input).

### Step 5
At the start of your intermediate level phase (high A2 to mid B2), you will then be able to transition to a more output oriented form of language learning
with the focus being on speaking and writing. You will have acquired sufficient knowledge on vocabulary and grammar, and now natives will correct you and orient you towards a more natural way or more correct way of communicating.

### Step 6
Enjoy the fruits of your labour as now, the world is your oyster. You can understand most content of your target language, and can just interact with it as you would normally with a preference for either input or output. Streaming services, theaters, travels amongst others will be options for you to continue learning more and more.

## What Is The End Goal of Language Learners?

Language learners have different goals when starting their journey. I personally learned German due to mainly wanting to study in Germany and Spanish out of fun and the love of language learning (especially a Romance language). It is quite important (imo) to set appropriate goals according to one's wants. Knowing the approximate region where one will reach that sweet spot corresponding to their goals is important. For instance, reaching a B2/C1 in German was a must for studying in a German-taught Engineering course. However, with the more casual environment I have in Spanish, a high B1 or mid B2 would suffice (even though my ultimate goal would be to align my Spanish with my other C1 languages).

Below I compiled common end goals for language learners that will guide you in choosing the appropriate route and content you will need to follow the previous steps that I listed.

1. ### Conversational Fluency
    - **Goal**: Hold natural conversations with native speakers and understand most spoken language.
    - **Level target**: B1â€“B2
    - **Learner type**: Expats, social learners, language exchange users, students.

2. ### Professional or Academic Proficiency
    - **Goal**: Use the language effectively in work or study â€” writing emails, reports, or essays, attending meetings, or giving presentations.
    - **Level target**: B2â€“C1
    - **Learner type**: Professionals, university students, researchers.

3. ### Cultural Connection
    - **Goal**: Engage deeply with a culture â€” literature, media, history, or family heritage.
    - **Level target**: B1+
    - **Learner type**: Heritage speakers, culture lovers, or fans of foreign films/music.

4. ### Travel or Relocation

    - **Goal**: Navigate life in a new country â€” housing, transportation, healthcare, etc.
    - **Level target**: A2â€“B1
    - **Learner type**: Immigrants, long-term travelers, digital nomads.

5. ### Relationship Building

    - **Goal**: Communicate with a partner, friends, or family in their native language.
    - **Level target**: B1â€“B2 (or conversational comfort)
    - **Learner type**: People in multicultural families or relationships.
