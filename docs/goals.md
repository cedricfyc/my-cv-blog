# Goals

This section aims to give you an idea of my progress on the website's content. Based on how feasible a feature is as I am working on it, it will either be implemented or cancelled and put into the trash.

## Implemented
- [x] Deploy Website
- [x] Complete CV and remaining empty pages
- [x] [giscus](https://giscus.app/) Discussion Section
- [x] Implement an [E-mail system](https://formspree.io/forms) to receive feedback
- [x] Implement a toggeable [light/dark mode](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/)
- [x] Add feedback feature and links to it at the end of articles
- [x] Add a footer with contact details
- [x] Add social card(s)
- [ ] Implement RSS feed
- [ ] Implement [newsletter system](https://buttondown.com/)
- [ ] Implement [GH Action](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages) for automatic updates of GH Pages
- [ ] Add model viewer from base HTML
- [ ] Add js backgrounds from [vantajs](https://www.vantajs.com/)
- [x] Add projects to project page
- [ ] Implement dynamic change log -> Python script with git and file management
    - To be implemented as a script that detects latest changes in git
    - Orders files in descending order of change timestamp for each file
    - Extracts the top 5 lines of the article to put into a summary .md file
    - Summary .md file with 5 or more articles will form the blog update page

## Cancelled

- [ ] ~~Implement analytics functions for feature improvement~~
    - Not possible due to lack of transparency around Google Analytics
    - Other analytics services were either paid or a pain to set-up
    - I deemed that a simple feedback form would be enough.
